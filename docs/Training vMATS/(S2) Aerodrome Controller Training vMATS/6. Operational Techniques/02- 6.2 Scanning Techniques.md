## 6.2.1 General Provisions
The controller scanning technique is a systematic method of visually and mentally observing all elements of the traffic situation to maintain situational awareness. It involves continuously sweeping across the radar display, flight strips, communication channels, and, when applicable, the aerodrome visual environment in a structured pattern rather than focusing on a single area. By alternating attention between traffic flows, potential conflict points, and support tools, the controller ensures that no aircraft or operational detail is overlooked. This constant, methodical observation cycle enables early detection of conflicts, adherence to separation standards, and timely decision-making.

## 6.2.2 Techniques

- **Runway Scan** <br> Regularly check active runways for aircraft on approach, departure, or occupying the surface.
- **Final Approach Scan** <br> Monitor the approach path for inbound traffic, ensuring spacing and alignment.
- **Circuit/Pattern Scan** <br> Observe the traffic circuit to maintain awareness of aircraft positions in all legs (upwind, crosswind, downwind, base, final).
- **Taxiway and Apron Scan** <br> Check ground movements, holding points, and intersections for potential conflicts.
- **Holding Point Scan** <br> Verify aircraft are correctly positioned and not infringing the runway.
- **Surrounding Airspace Scan** <br> Observe airspace near the aerodrome for VFR arrivals, zone transits, or unexpected traffic.
- **Departure/Arrival list Scan** <br> Review the available lists and flight data to update sequencing and confirm clearances.
- **Radar/Surveillance Aid Scan (if available)** <br> Cross-check local traffic picture with radar or surveillance tools to validate positions and detect potential conflicts.
- **Frequency/Communication Scan** <br> Maintain active listening on ATC frequencies to detect calls, requests, or missed transmissions.
- **Environment Scan** <br> Remain alert to external factors such as vehicles, personnel, weather changes, or runway incursions.
