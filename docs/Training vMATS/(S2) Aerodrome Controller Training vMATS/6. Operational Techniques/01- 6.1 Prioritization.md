## 6.1.1 Operational priority
Refers to the process of determining which aircraft or tasks take precedence in order to maintain order and continuity of air traffic operations. In practice, controllers assign priority based on hierarchy established criteria:

- **Go Around and Conflicts** <br> Go-arounds and traffic conflicts are assigned **the highest level of prioritization**, as they involve immediate and dynamic situations that require rapid controller intervention. A go-around disrupts the normal traffic sequence and introduces potential interaction with other arrivals or departures, while a conflict indicates an imminent or actual loss of separation. In both cases, controller attention is focused on resolving the situation without delay to restore order within the traffic pattern.

- **Landing** <br> Landing aircraft are afforded **the second highest level of prioritization**, as they are committed to a controlled approach and have limited flexibility to maneuver compared to aircraft in other phases of flight. Once established on final, their trajectory, speed, and altitude are constrained, requiring controllers to sequence them ahead of less critical traffic in order to maintain continuity and reduce the risk of disruption to the approach path.

- **Airspace** <br> Airspace management holds a subsequent level of prioritization, as the integrity of controlled sectors must be preserved to accommodate both IFR and VFR operations. Controllers ensure that aircraft entering, exiting, or transiting a defined portion of airspace are sequenced and coordinated in line with established procedures. Maintaining structured use of the airspace prevents congestion, reduces the likelihood of conflicts, and supports the orderly progression of all flights within and across sector boundaries.

- **Take-off** <br> Departing aircraft are assigned a level of prioritization that follows landing and immediate traffic conflicts. Takeoff operations require coordination to ensure proper spacing from other departures, arrivals, and circuit traffic. While pilots have flexibility in the climb and initial routing, controllers sequence departures to maintain an orderly flow and prevent interference with higher-priority traffic, ensuring smooth integration into en-route or local airspace.

- **Taxi** <br> Taxiing aircraft are given the next level of prioritization after airborne operations. Controllers manage ground movements to prevent conflicts on taxiways and runways, coordinating departures and arrivals while maintaining an orderly flow of traffic on the aerodrome surface.

- **Pushback** <br> Pushback operations are assigned a lower priority than airborne or taxiing aircraft. Controllers coordinate pushbacks to ensure they do not interfere with active taxiways, departures, or arrivals, scheduling movements to maintain smooth ground operations.

- **Clearance** <br> Clearance delivery is assigned the lowest priority within the traffic management hierarchy. Controllers issue clearances for departure, route, or flight level changes as workload permits, ensuring that higher-priority operations—such as airborne traffic, landings, and departures—are managed first.

- **Other Requests** <br> Other requests, such as non-urgent pilot inquiries or administrative coordination, are given the lowest priority within air traffic operations. These requests are addressed once all higher-priority tasks—such as go-arounds, landings, departures, and taxi movements—have been managed.
