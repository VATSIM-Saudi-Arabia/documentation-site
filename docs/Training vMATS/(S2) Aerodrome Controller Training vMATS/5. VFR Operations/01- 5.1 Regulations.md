## 5.1.1 General Provisions
**Visual Flight Rules (VFR)** flights are **“see-and-avoid” flights**. Pilots are primarily responsible for avoiding other aircraft and obstacles, but the controller may provide traffic information and sequencing as required by the airspace class and applicable regulations to support orderly operations.
