## 5.2.1 General Provisions
While pilots are responsible for maintaining visual separation, Aerodrome controllers oversee and provide guidance and information to support situational awareness. There are common procedures usually practiced to keep flights safe and coordinated.

### 5.2.1.1 Traffic Circuits
A **traffic circuit** (or **traffic pattern**) is a standardized flight path around an aerodrome that organizes aircraft for **take-off, landing, and pattern operations**. It consists of several key components:

- **Upwind Leg** <br> The initial climb after take-off, aligned with the runway heading.
- **Downwind Leg** <br> Parallel to the runway but in the opposite direction of landing; used for positioning and spacing.
- **Base Leg** <br> The turn from downwind toward the final approach, perpendicular to the runway.
- **Final Approach** <br> The last leg, aligned with the runway centerline, where the aircraft descends for landing
- **Entry/Exit Points** <br> Designated points for joining or leaving the circuit, often via controller instructions.

    Additional elements can include **circuit altitude, direction of turns (usually left-hand unless otherwise specified), and visual reporting points** for communication with TWR.

### 5.2.1.2 Departure/Arrival

- **Departure Procedures (Exiting the CTR)** <br> When a VFR aircraft departs from an aerodrome within a Control Zone (CTR), it must follow designated VFR departure routes or clearance instructions issued by TWR. These procedures typically involve departing via published VFR exit points or radial references that guide the aircraft safely out of controlled airspace while maintaining separation from IFR traffic. The pilot is expected to remain clear of restricted areas, adhere to altitude restrictions, and report leaving the CTR. Once outside, the aircraft is usually transferred to an adjacent unit (e.g., Approach, Area, or UNICOM).

- **Arrival Procedures (Entering the CTR)** <br> For arrivals, VFR flights must obtain clearance before entering the CTR. Pilots are instructed to approach via published entry points, visual reporting landmarks, or headings assigned by TWR. Once inside the CTR, the aircraft is directed toward the circuit, final approach, or other traffic patterns as appropriate.

### 5.2.1.3 Zone Transit

- **Zone Transit Procedures (CTR transit)** <br> When a VFR aircraft intends to fly through a Control Zone (CTR) without departing from or arriving at the aerodrome, it must first obtain clearance from TWR before entry. The controller will issue instructions regarding the approved routing, altitude, and visual reporting points to ensure safe integration with IFR arrivals and departures. These transits are normally conducted via designated VFR transit routes or visual reference points that keep aircraft clear of critical traffic flows, such as final approach or departure paths. Pilots are expected to maintain a good lookout, comply strictly with TWR instructions, and report position as requested.
