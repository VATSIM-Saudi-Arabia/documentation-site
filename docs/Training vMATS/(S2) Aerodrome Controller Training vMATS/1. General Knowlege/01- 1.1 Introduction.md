**The Aerodrome, i.e. Tower Controller** is responsible for the safe, orderly, and efficient flow of aircraft operating within the immediate vicinity of an aerodrome. Working from the control tower, the controller issues **takeoff and landing clearances, manages runway and taxiway operations, and ensures proper sequencing of arriving and departing traffic**. On VATSIM network, aerodrome controllers replicate these same duties in a simulated environment, providing pilots with clear, concise, and professional instructions that mirror real-world procedures.
