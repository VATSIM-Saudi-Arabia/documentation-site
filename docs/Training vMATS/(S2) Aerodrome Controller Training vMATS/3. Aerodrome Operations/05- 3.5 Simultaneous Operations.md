## 3.5.1 General Provisions
**Simultaneous runway operations** refer to the coordinated use of two or more runways at the same aerodrome, enabling parallel or intersecting activity under specific regulatory provisions.

---

## 3.5.2 Parallel
A parallel runway operation involves the coordinated use of two or more runways **aligned in the same direction, designed to facilitate simultaneous or near-simultaneous aircraft movements**. These configurations can be employed for independent or dependent approaches, independent departures, or segregated operations, with the chosen mode dictated by runway spacing, traffic demand, and regulatory provisions.

### 3.5.2.1 Approaches

#### 3.5.2.1.1 Independent Parallel Approach (Mode 1)
Parallel runways are used for simultaneous arrivals without mandatory sequencing between aircraft on adjacent approaches.
Mode 1 Configration consist of the follwing:

- Intrument Approach
- Non Transgression Zone (NTZ)
- Safe Operating Zone (SOZ)
- Final Approach Monitoring Controller; has the ability to
    - Step over the TWR frequency
    - Issue Break out maneuver
- No Diagonal Separation Required
- Missed Approach Tracks diverge by minimum of 30 degrees

#### 3.5.2.1.2 Dependent Parallel Approach (Mode 2)
Parallel runways accommodate simultaneous arrivals with spacing and sequencing requirements enforced to ensure separation, which consists the follwing:

- Diagonal Separation of 3 NM
- No Final Approach Monitoring Controller Required
- No NTZ/SOZ
- Missed Approach Tracks Diverge my minimum of 30 degrees

!!! Info "Do note"
    For every 3 nm of diagonal separation, each parallel traffic is separated of 1000 ft vertically.

### 3.5.2.2 Departures

#### 3.5.2.2.1 Independent Parallel Departures (Mode 3)
Parallel runways are employed for departures without interdependence, provided separation minima are maintained.

### 3.5.2.3 Segregated Parallel Operations (Mode 4)
One runway is dedicated to arrivals while the other is allocated to departures, optimizing flow distribution.

#### 3.5.2.3.1 Semi-Mixed

#### 3.5.2.3.2 Mixed Operations

## 3.5.3 Near Parallel
A near-parallel runway operation refers to the use of two or more runways oriented with only a slight divergence or convergence, typically less than 15 degrees apart. While resembling parallel layouts, their geometry imposes additional procedural constraints, requiring tailored separation standards and specialized approach or departure procedures to ensure safe and coordinated utilization.
