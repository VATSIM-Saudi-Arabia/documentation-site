## 3.1.1 General Provisions
There are **three principal types of runway operations**, each governed by specific procedures and coordinated control measures:

- **Departure:** <br> Controlled use of a runway exclusively for the takeoff phase of aircraft movements.
- **Arrival:** <br> Dedicated use of a runway solely for the landing phase of aircraft movements.
- **Mixed Operations:** <br> The utilization of one or more runways for both departures and arrivals under coordinated control.

## 3.1.2 Configuration
Aerodrome Controller is fundamentally responsible to select the most suitable runway configuration, as it directly influences the safety, efficiency, and continuity of aerodrome operations. Several factors must be considered:

- **Wind Conditions** <br> Runways should normally be selected to align as closely as possible with the prevailing wind. Operating into a headwind reduces the aircraftâ€™s ground roll, provides better climb performance, and lowers landing distance requirements. Conversely, tailwinds increase takeoff and landing distance, reduce climb gradients, and may exceed aircraft limitations. As a rule of practice, a runway should not be used if the tailwind component exceeds 7 knots, unless safety, procedures, or aircraft performance considerations permit. Crosswind limits must also be observed, as strong crosswinds can challenge directional control during takeoff and landing.

- **Weather Phenomena** <br> Visibility, ceiling, and significant weather such as rain, thunderstorms, fog, or snow affect the suitability of approaches and departures. Controllers should select runways that provide the best alignment with available instrument approach procedures under low visibility, and avoid directing traffic into areas of known weather hazards (e.g., storm cells on final approach).

- **Runway Availability** <br> At times, certain runways may be unavailable due to maintenance, works in progress, inspections, snow/ice clearing, or surface contamination (e.g., standing water, ice, snow). Controllers must select the operational runway(s) based on what is declared open and safe, ensuring braking action reports and runway condition assessments are factored into the decision.

- **NOTAMs and Restrictions** <br> Notices to Airmen may impose limitations on specific runways, such as temporary closures, displaced thresholds, obstacle hazards, or revised procedures. Runway selection must comply with all active NOTAMs to avoid routing traffic into restricted or unsafe conditions.

- **Instrument Procedures** <br> The availability of published instrument approach and departure procedures directly influences runway choice. For IFR traffic, runways with ILS, RNAV, or precision approach aids are preferred in reduced visibility. The selected configuration must allow both IFR and VFR flights to operate consistently with published procedures.

- **Noise Abatement Procedures** <br> Many aerodromes are subject to environmental restrictions requiring specific runways or routes to be used at particular times of day or under certain conditions. Controllers must take these requirements into account, balancing operational needs with regulatory compliance and community impact.

- **Traffic Demand and Flow** <br> Runway selection should also consider the balance between arrivals and departures. Using parallel or intersecting runways in specific configurations may minimize taxi times, reduce airborne holding, and maintain smoother sequencing of traffic. The chosen configuration must support the overall efficiency of traffic handling without compromising established limitations.

- **Operational Coordination** <br> Runway use may need to align with the operations of adjacent airports, military airspace, or neighboring control sectors to ensure consistency of traffic flow. Coordinated use prevents conflicts with shared airspace, reduces handover complexity, and maintains predictable routing for aircraft.

- **Emergency or Contingency Needs** <br> In special cases, such as aircraft emergencies, medical flights, or declared low-fuel states, controllers may need to assign a runway that offers the most direct access regardless of the standard configuration. This flexibility ensures that urgent or priority operations can be accommodated promptly.
