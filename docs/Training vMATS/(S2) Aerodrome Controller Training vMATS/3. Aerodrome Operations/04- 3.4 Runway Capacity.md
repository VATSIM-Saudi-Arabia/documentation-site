## 3.4.1 General Provisions
**Runway capacity** is the maximum sustainable rate of aircraft movements—arrivals, departures, or mixed operations—that can be accommodated on a runway system under given conditions without incurring unacceptable delays. It is influenced by factors such as:

- Runway Occupancy
    - Runway exits
- Wake Vortex Separation
    - DEP/ARR Sequencing
- Weather Conditions
- Traffic Mix
- Environment and Noise

Determining capacity requires balancing operational throughput with regulatory constraints and safety margins, making it a critical parameter in aerodrome planning and traffic management.
