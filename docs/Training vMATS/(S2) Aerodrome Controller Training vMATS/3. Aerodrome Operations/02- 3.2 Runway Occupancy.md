## 3.2.1 General Provisions
Runway occupancy denotes the interval an aircraft occupies the runway, from entry to full vacating within the aerodrome.

!!! info "Do note"
    The runway-in-use is not considered occupied when the following conditions are met:

    - Departing traffic passes the end of the runway threshold.
    - Departing traffic starts its turn.
    - Arriving traffic vacates the runway fully.

</p>
!!! danger "Be careful!"
    Controllers **must not** issue take-off nor landing clearances when the runway-in-use is occupied.

## 3.2.2 Minimum Runway Occupancy
In order to maximize runway capacity **pilots shall minimize runway occupancy time**.

### 3.2.2.1 Arrivals
- Unless otherwise advised by Controller, expect to vacate the runway via a RET.
- Controller may advise pilots on final approach of the expected runway exit point otherwise pilots scan vacate at the closest suitable exit.
- Controller should expect the pilots to vacate the runway expeditiously.

> **AIR**: *"SVA123, Plan to vacate M4, continue approach runway 34R, number one"*

### 3.2.2.2 Departures
- On receipt of the line-up clearance, pilots shall taxi into position expeditiously.
- Controller may be able to make changes in the departure sequence when necessary if pilots require more separation than the WTS time-based standard or extra time for any other reason.

!!! Caution "Do note"
    Controllers must evaluate aircraft performance, operational conditions, and runway utilization to coordinate clearances and maintain seamless transitions between runway and taxiway operations.

## 3.2.3 Holding Points
Managing holding points involves controlling the positioning of aircraft at specific locations on the movement area, usually near runway entries and main taxiway intersections. Controllers sequence traffic, keep protected areas clear, and release movements only when conditions allow. This requires close monitoring of runway use, coordination between ground and tower to prevent incursions and maintain steady traffic flow.
!!! info "Beware"
    The runway-in-use will be considered occupied if an aircraft remains within; or transgresses the holding point into **Runway Safety Area**.

## 3.2.4 Runway Incursion
If an aerodrome controller, after a take-off clearance or landing clearance has been issued becomes aware of a runway incursion, or imminent runway incursion, the following action should be taken:

- Cancel the take-off clearance for a departing aircraft;
- Instruct a landing aircraft to execute a go-around or missed approach;
- In all cases inform the aircraft of the obstruction or incursion and its location in relation to the runway.

> **AIR:** *"SVA123, Hold position, cancel take-off clearance, I say again CANCEL take-off clearance due to runway incursion, ACKNOWLEDGE"*
