**Airspace** is the portion of the atmosphere managed for regulated operation of aircraft. It is organized to allow orderly movement of traffic, provide separation between flights, and define the responsibilities of pilots and controllers. By structuring the sky into different classes, air traffic services can maintain safety, reduce the risk of collisions, and ensure that both controlled and uncontrolled operations are conducted efficiently.

Airspace is generally divided into the following classes: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Each class has **specific rules and levels of control**, which guide how aircraft are separated and how pilots interact with air traffic services.
