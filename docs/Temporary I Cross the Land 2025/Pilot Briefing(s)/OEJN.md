!!! success "covering" 
    This is the Cross the Land: 2025 pilot briefing of **King Abdulaziz International Airport**. All pilots flying in this event **MUST FULLY READ AND UNDERSTAND** this briefing.
!!! warning
    All the following informationdocumented is intended for flight simulation purposes and must not be used for any real-world aviation uses.
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Event Overview
One of VATSIM’s largest and most anticipated events is back! **Cross the Land** brings together hundreds of pilots and controllers from across the globe for an unforgettable journey across **Europe and the Middle East**.

In 2025, we head **eastbound** – departing from some of Europe’s busiest hubs towards the heart of the Middle East. Expect full ATC coverage along the entire route, challenging long-haul flights, a realistic traffic environment, and the unique atmosphere that makes this event so special.

### 1.2 Pilots Flying without Slots
It is mandatory for all pilots participating in the event to reserve a slot on [Cross The Land: Eastbound 2025 Bookings](https://ctl.vatsim.me/cross-the-land-eastbound-2025/bookings).

Pilots who do not have a slot booked may face significant delays and are advised to carry
additional fuel in case they need to hold in the air.

### 1.3 Flight Plan
Pilots shall comply with the designated **standard terminal arrival route (STAR)** and procedures as assigned by ATC. Deviations from these routes shall not be made without prior ATC clearance. Unauthorized deviations may adversely affect sequencing, alter the **estimated time of arrival (ETA)**, and lead to the forfeiture of an allocated arrival slot.

Furthermore, pilots are kindly requested to ensure they have the most up-to-date **Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control (AIRAC) cycle** installed in their navigation
database.

!!! danger "IMPORTANT NOTICE!"
    All pilots flying into **King Abdulaziz International Airport (OEJN)** are hereby reminded that strict familiarization with the aerodrome procedures is mandatory, with particular emphasis on **Arrival Taxi Routes**.
    
    - Due to the complexity of the airfield layout, estimated high traffic density, and simultaneous use of multiple runways, any lack of awareness may disturb the arrival flow or result in unnecessary workload for ATC.
    
    - Pilots are required to review the latest charts prior to connecting inro the network, ensure full briefing of expected arrival taxi routes, and comply precisely with all ATC instructions without deviation. 
    
    - Request clarification **immediately if in doubt**, as failure to adhere to these procedures will not be appreciated and may compromise the safe and orderly flow of traffic at OEJN.

#### 3.1.1 Radar Vectors on Downwind
Traffic can expect standard vectors on Downwind.

|   **Runway 34L**   |    **Runway 34R**    |
| :----------------: | :------------------: |
| Left 070, Left 010 | Right 250, Right 310 |

#### 3.1.2 Speed Restrictions
All speed restrictions on the STAR are mandatory and must be complied with unless otherwise
instructed by ATC. Pilots shall strictly adhere to the speed assigned by ATC and shall request
ATC approval before making any changes thereto. If it is essential to make an immediate
temporary change in speed, e.g. due to turbulence, ATC shall be notified as soon as possible.

Pilots should anticipate the following standard speed restrictions. ATC will confirm speed
restriction instructions.

|    **Speed**    |                    **Position**                   |
| :-------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
| 280 - 250 Knots |             From TMA entry to Downwind            |
| 230 – 210 Knots |                    On Downwind                    |
| 210 - 180 Knots |             From Downwind to Base leg             |
| 190 - 160 Knots | On base leg and Closing Heading to Final Approach |
|    180 Knots    |                10 NM from Touchdown               |
|    180 Knots    |                 4 NM from Touchdown               |
!!! Warning "Caution"
    If speed control is considered excessive or contrary to safe aircraft operation, ATC must be
    informed without delay.

#### 3.1.3 Altitude Restrictions
All altitude restrictions on the STAR are mandatory and must be complied with unless
otherwise instructed by ATC.

#### 3.1.4 Initial Contact
##### 3.1.4.1 Jeddah Approach
On initial contact with Jeddah Approach, aircraft are to pass the following information:

- Callsign and Passing Level
- Aircraft Type (include the word “HEAVY” if applicable)
- STAR designation
- ATIS information and QNH
- Advise in the event full length runway is required [If required]

##### 3.1.4.2 Jeddah Final
When establishing initial contact with Jeddah Final [FIN 1], it is requested that pilots **ONLY**
provide their callsign **WITHOUT ANY** additional information. The controller does not require
any further details at that point.

### 3.2 Radar Vector Arrival
If pilots are unable to fly an RNAV (Area Navigation) Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR),
they can anticipate receiving radar vectors from air traffic control upon arrival. The radar
vectors given by APP 1/FIN will guide them along the appropriate route instead of following
the predefined RNAV STAR.
!!! Info "Beware"
    When the **Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** reaches full capacity, pilots can anticipate being directed to unpublished holding patterns at the entry points of **VEMEM, BOSUT, MUVOL**, and **NOMDA**.

### 3.3 Runway Operations
#### 3.3.1 Declared Distances (Landing)
| **Runway** | **Landing Distance Available (at Threshold)** |
| :--------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
|    34L     |                    3800 m                     |
|    34R     |                    4000 m                     |
|    34C     |                    4000 m                     |
|    16L     |                    4000 m                     |
|    16C     |                    4000 m                     |
|    16R     |                    3800 m                     |

#### 3.3.2 Minimum Runway Occupancy Time
To maximize runway utilization at King Abdulaziz International Airport, pilots must follow the
following procedures:

1. Aircraft should vacate the runway promptly using a pre-planned runway exit point
provided by the AIR (Tower). This helps to ensure the efficient flow of traffic.
2. Pilots are reminded not to reduce speed to less than normal taxi speed until the aircraft
has completely passed the runway holding point. This allows for continuous movement
and prevents congestion.
3. After vacating the runway, pilots must immediately follow the assigned Arrival Taxi Route
as directed by the AIR (Tower). This helps to maintain orderly taxi operations and minimize
delays.

#### 3.3.3 Standard Vacating Points
During the final approach, pilots will receive a designated vacating point from AIR (Tower). It is
crucial for pilots to apply the appropriate brake power to ensure they neither overshoot nor
undershoot the designated vacating point.

Pilots with confirmed bookings can anticipate being assigned the following vacating points:

| **Runway** | **Vacating Point** |
| :--------: | :----------------: |
|     34L    |         B5         |
|     34R    |         M7         |
|     16L    |         M4         |
|     16R    |         B2         |

#### 3.3.4 Missed Approach Procedure
Fly the published missed approach unless otherwise instructed by ATC.

### 3.4 Arrival Taxi Procedure
All aircraft participating in the event will be allocated a parking stand relative to the arrival runway.

- **For aircraft vacating Runway 34R** <br> They can expect to be assigned Vacating Point **M7** by AIR 2 (Tower East). They will then be provided with an Arrival Taxi Route of **M7X** or **M7O**. Control will be handed over to GMC 2 (Ground East), where the GMC controller will guide them via taxiway L or R then hold short of V, After the handoff, APN E (Apron East) will guide them to the assigned stand.
- **For aircraft vacating Runway 34L** <br> They should anticipate being assigned Vacating Point B5 by AIR 1. The assigned Arrival Taxi Route will be **B5X** or **B5O**, guiding them to Apron 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 via taxiways B or C.
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
To be continued
</p>

#### 3.4.1 Arrival Taxi Routes (ATRs)
**Arrival Taxi Routes (ATRs)** are short pre-defined initial taxi paths for traffic that are designed to maintain a smooth flow of traffic after aircraft vacate the runway. These routes are established to prevent traffic congestion around the RETs and to optimize the tower's efficiency by avoiding the need to provide initial taxiway instructions. Instead, the tower instructs the aircraft to follow one of the predetermined ATRs based on the assigned parking stand by the Ground (GND) controller.

This allows for a smooth and immediate transfer of traffic to the appropriate ground
controller.
