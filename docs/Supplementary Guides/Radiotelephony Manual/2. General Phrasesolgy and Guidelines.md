- Callsigns, except who has a known callsign
- Airways, except U letter which is called Upper

All numbers must be transmitted by pronouncing each digit separately in the following cases:
- Aircraft callsigns
- Flight levels
- Headings
- Wind direction and speed
- Transponder codes
- Runway/taxiway designators
- Altimeter settings
- Times
- Frequencies

All numbers used in the transmission of aircraft call-signs, flight levels, headings, wind direction and
speed, transponder codes, runway/taxiway designators, altimeter settings, time, and frequencies
must be transmitted by pronouncing each digit separately:

- Taxiway designators - First option: Standard Phraseology: “HOTEL 1”
- Taxiway designators - Second option: Standard Phraseology combined with Repeated
Standard Phraseology: “MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA, I SAY AGAIN, HOTEL 1”

## 2.3 Transmitting Time

When transmitting time, only the minutes of the hour are normally required. Each digit should be
pronounced separately, however the hour should be included when any possibility of confusion is
likely to result.

**Co-ordinated universal time (UTC/” Zulu”)** shall be used.

Pilots may check the time with the appropriate ATS unit. Time checks must be given to the nearest
half minute.

> Pilot: *SVA123, Request Time Check*
> Controller: *SVA123, TIME 0911*
***OR***
> Controller: *SVA123, TIME 0911 And a Half*

## 2.4 Standard Phrases

The following words and phrases must be used in radiotelephony communications as appropriate
and when used have the meaning given below.

The phrase “GO AHEAD” should be avoided, in its place the use of the calling aeronautical stations
call sign followed by the answering aeronautical stations call sign shall be considered the invitation
to proceed with transmission by the station calling.

## 2.5 Transfer of Communications
An aircraft shall be advised by the appropriate aeronautical station to change from one radio
frequency to another in accordance with letter of agreements between ATS units.
