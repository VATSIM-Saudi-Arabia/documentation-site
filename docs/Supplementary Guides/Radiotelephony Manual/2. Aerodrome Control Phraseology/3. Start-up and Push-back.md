title: 3. Start-up and Push-back
---

## 3.1 Start-up clearance
Requests to start engines are normally made to assist ATC in traffic planning and to prevent unnecessary fuel consumption by aircraft experiencing ground delays. When making such a request, the pilot shall state the aircraft’s location and confirm receipt of the current ATIS broadcast.
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "RIYADH GROUND, HAZAZ, STAND A5 REQUEST START UP, INFORMATION BRAVO"

    **Controller**: 'HAZAZ, START UP APPROVED QNH 1009"

## 3.2 Push-back clearance
At most aerodromes, including those within Saudi Arabia, aircraft are parked with the nose oriented toward the terminal and require a pushback prior to taxi for departure. Requests for pushback shall be made in accordance with local aerodrome-specific ground movement procedures.
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "Jeddah GROUND, SAUDIA 123, STAND 4-4 REQUEST PUSH AND START, INFORMATION CHARLIE"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, STAND 4-4 PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE TO THE SOUTH"

### 3.2.1 Conditional Push-back clearance
In certain situations, conditional pushback instructions may be given when there is an aircraft taxiing behind another aircraft that is waiting for pushback.
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "Jeddah GROUND, SAUDIA 123, STAND 4-4 REQUEST PUSH AND START, INFORMATION CHARLIE"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, BEHIND THE BRITISH AIRWAYS B777 PASSING LEFT TO RIGHT, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE SOUTH. BEHIND"
