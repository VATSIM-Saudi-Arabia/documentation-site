title: 4. Taxi Instructions

## 4.1 Taxi clearance
The pilot of the aircraft is required to state their location when either requesting to start engines,
pushback or when requesting taxi clearance

Taxi instructions issued by a controller will always contain a **clearance limit**, which is the point at
which the aircraft must stop until further permission to proceed is given. For departing aircraft, the clearance limit will normally be the taxi-holding point of the runway in use, but it may be any other position on the aerodrome depending on the prevailing traffic circumstances.
!!! info "Do note"
    When a taxi clearance includes a taxi limit extending beyond a runway, it shall specify either an explicit **clearance to cross** or an **instruction to hold short** of that runway.

!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "SAUDIA 123 STAND A11, REQUEST TAXI"

    **Controller**: "TAXI VIA LA, L2, MF, M1, HOLDING POINT RUNWAY 34R"

    **Pilot**: "TAXI VIA LA, L2, MF, M1, HOLDING POINT RUNWAY 34R, SAUDIA 123"
