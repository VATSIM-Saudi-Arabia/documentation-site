Welcome to the ECFMP (European Collaboration & Flow Management Project) Control system. Using ECFMP, official flow measures are issued to the participating Divisions and vACCs by both discord notifications and via ECFMP's API.

The Saudi Arabian vACC utlizes this system when deemed neccesary to enforce flow measures.
