## What is VCCS?

## Using VCCS
To open VCCS, click **Other SET > Open VCCS Dialogue**. This will open a new window.
Before you can start using VCCS, you have to do a little bit of set up. Click EDIT to open the settings. In the Nickname box, put your VATSIM CID. Using the (G2G) button to the right, set your Push To Talk Button. 

At the bottom of the dialogue box, under Devices, set your Capture and Playback devices. Hit OK and you are good to go!

The VCCS window is split into two halves. On the right is the Direct Access pane, of which there are three sections. It contains a list of ATC positions.

- Direct Access 1 --> CTR Positions
- Direct Access 2 --> APP Positions
- Direct Access 3 --> GND/TWR Positions

---

- A yellow outline around a position denotes that the position is online but not using VCCS. See LTAA CTR on the above picture.
- A red outline clearly shows that a position is offline.
- A green outline denotes that the position is online and using VCCS.

On the left side of the window is the control pane. A few of these buttons when 
clicked say that they are not modelled yet, however a few are functional.

-The Direct Access buttons can be used to switch page on the Direct Access panels. 
- The Mute button mutes the call, not yourself.
- Ring Off can be clicked to stop the ringing tone when somebody calls you.
- End simply ends the current call, and
- Test is very self explanatory

## How to call another positions
If you are going to call another sector, make sure you see it in your sector list, because otherwise it will not work if you are going to call someone and in VCCS dialog the sector will have a red outline. If the sector you are going to call in the sector list, place VIS in the place where the sector you want to call is located and you will see it in your sector list and in VCCS dialog it will be green outline.

**Clicking on a position starts a call with them.**
