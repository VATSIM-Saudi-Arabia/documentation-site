### 2.2. AIR W [Jeddah Tower West]
**Jeddah Tower West [OEJN_W_TWR]** covers the western and center runways:

- 34L/16R
- 34C/16C

####  2.2.1 Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)
**Jeddah Tower West [OEJN_W_TWR]** covers the following VRPs in the Jeddah Control Zone [CTR]:

- VRP07
- VRP08
- VRP09
- VRP10
- VRP11

### 2.3. AIR E [Jeddah Tower East]
**Jeddah Tower East [OEJN_E_TWR]** covers the eastern runway:

- 34R/16L
####  2.3.1 Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)
**Jeddah Tower East [OEJN_E_TWR]** covers the following VRPs in the Jeddah Control Zone [CTR]:

- VRP02
- VRP03
- VRP04
- VRP12

### 2.4. Standard Connection Hierarchy 
Controllers must log in the following order to maintain realizm and follow SOPs: 

- AIR W [OEJN_W_TWR]
- AIR E [OEJN_E_TWR]

 This hierarchy of connection must always be followed unless ATS staff explictly permit you to do otherwise.

 ---

## 3. Runway Configurations

### 3.1 General
The hierarchy of responsibility for determining the runway configuration is outlined as follows:

 - AIR W
 - APP
 - CTR
 - SMC W
 - GMP

!!! tip "Do note"
    It is the **ultimate responsibility** of the tower controllers to set the active runways! In any airport!

    So as long as there is a tower controller, it is his responsibility to set the active runway and ATIS, if not online, follow the hierarchy above

### 3.2 Preferential Runway System [PRS]
In Jeddah, the Preferential Runway System is in use. In conditions of slack winds, 34 operation is preferred up to a tailwind component of 6kts.

This is the more efficent configuration, thus it is used as much as possible.

!!! tip "Crosswind"
    In the event of a direct crosswind (250 degrees) with a speed exceeding 7 knots, the following guidelines should be followed to determine the runway configuration:

    - Check the Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) for any indications of a potential change in weather conditions that may necessitate a different runway configuration.
    - If the TAF suggests a possible shift in weather conditions that would favor an alternative configuration, select the runway configuration that aligns with the forecasted conditions.
    - However, if the TAF does not indicate any expected changes that would warrant a different configuration, default to using the 34 Configs (presumably a reference to a specific set of runway configurations).

### 3.3 Standard Runway Configuration
At King Abdulaziz International Airport, standard runway configurations for normal operations are established and ranked in order of preference. 

The configurations, listed from most preferred to least preferred, are as follows:

- 34s [DDRO]
- 34s [SDRO]
- 16s [DDRO]
- 16s [SDRO]

!!! info "Do note."
    Exceptions to runway configurations can be granted per pilot's request after approval from AIR and APP. 

    **Standard Exceptions:**

    - VFR Circuits
    - Royal Flights [Always departs/arrives on 34L/16R regardless of the active config]
    - Military Flights [Always departs/arrives on 34R/16L regardless of the active config]

#### 3.3.1. Dual Departure Runway Operations [DDRO]
In the context of runway operations at King Abdulaziz International Airport, the most preferred configuration is the **Dual Departure Runway Operations (DDRO)**. This configuration involves utilizing both the center and eastern runways specifically for departures.

By using this configuration, the airport can maximize its departure capacity and efficiently manage the flow of departing aircraft. It allows for simultaneous departures from two runways, thereby reducing congestion and minimizing delays during peak traffic periods.

DDRO is considered the most preferred configuration due to its ability to enhance the airport's operational efficiency and optimize the utilization of available runway resources.

#### 3.3.2. Single Departure Runway Operations [SDRO]
**Single Departure Runway Operations (SDRO)** is a runway configuration utilized at King Abdulaziz International Airport, though it is considered less preferred compared to other configurations. SDRO involves utilizing the center runway, exclusively for departures while the other runways are  used for arrivals. 

While this configuration allows for efficient management of departing aircraft, it can result in reduced departure capacity and potential delays, especially during periods of high traffic demand. 

However, SDRO may be implemented due to operational constraints or specific circumstances that limit the availability of other runways.

---
##  4. Procedures
The below procedures are considered as standard and no coordination is required to employ them, except where explicitly required.

!!! caution 
    Should a situation arise that does not match any of the below cases, coordinate an arrangement with the affected agencies

 ### 4.1 Departure procedures
 ####    4.1.1. Departure points

 |       **Runway**       |     **Departure point**     |

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.2.1. - Departure points
</p>


#### 4.1.2. Line up clearances

Conditional line up instructions shall include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission.

**AIR:** *“FAD123, Behind the departing Saudia A321, Via M1, line up runway 34R behind”*

If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

Example: *“SVA123, Via M1, line up runway 34R”*

#### 4.1.3. Take-off clearances

Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists

**Air:** *“SVA123, Winds 340 degrees 10knots, Runway 34R, cleared for take-off”*

#### 4.1.4. Parallel Departure

**Independent Parallel Departure Operations (Mode 3)** are permitted at Jeddah from runways 34C/34R and 16C/16L.

#### 4.1.5. Separation requirements

Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima, standard wake turbulence separation or RE-CAT.

Succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of 2 minutes.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.

#### 4.1.6. Low visibility and IMC

During low visibility operations and during IMC, departing aircraft shall not be cleared for take-off when there is an arriving aircraft within 4 NM of the landing runway threshold.

Traffic should report **"airborne"** after take-off. Once airborne they should then be handed off to the appropriate station.

#### 4.1.7. IFR handoff procedure

IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate departure controller as instructed.

#### 4.1.8. Stopping a departure

If the departing aircraft has to abort takeoff, the Tower controller shall use the following
phraseology and instruct the aircraft twice. After the instruction, the Tower controller shall
confirm that the aircraft has acknowledged the cancel takeoff instruction.

This is a common occurrence on VATSIM when an aircraft randomly connects to the network while
on an active runway. Once conditions permit, if the aircraft needs to return to the end of
the runway for takeoff, the Tower controller shall instruct the aircraft to hold short of the
closest taxiway parallel to the active runway and hand off the aircraft to Ground.

> *(Takeoff roll commenced)* **AIR:** *"SVA123 stop immediately, I say again stop immediately. Aknowledge"*

> *(Takeoff roll not commenced)* **AIR:***"SVA123 hold position, cancel takeoff clearance. I say again cancel takeoff clearance, due ground crew on runway"*

###  4.2 Arrival procedures

#### 4.2.1. Preferred exit points

|       **Runway**       |     **Exit points**     |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|        34L       |        B5, B8 / A5       |
|        34R       |        M4, M6, M7 / N5       |
|        16L       |        M3, M5 / N4       |
|        16R       |        B2, B4 / A2       |
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.1.1 - Preferred exit points
</p>


On initial contact with AIR, traffic **must** be advised to expect an exit point along with a landing clearance.

> **AIR:** *"SVA123, Plan to vacate M6, winds 340 degrees 10kts, runway 34R, cleared to land"*

#### 4.2.2. Arrival taxi routes

Arrival Taxi Routes (ATRs) are short pre-defined initial taxi paths for traffic that are designed to maintain a smooth flow of traffic after aircraft vacate the runway. These routes are established to prevent traffic congestion around the RETs and to optimize the tower's efficiency by avoiding the need to provide initial taxiway instructions. Instead, the tower instructs the aircraft to follow one of the predetermined ATRs based on the assigned parking stand by the Ground (GND) controller.

This allows for a smooth and immediate transfer of traffic to the appropriate ground controller.

!!! caution "Do Note"
    The Tower controller is responsible for assigning the Arrival Taxi Route (ATR) to aircraft.

    Example: 

    Pilot: *SVA123, vacating via M6*
    AIR: *SVA123, Follow the M6A Arrival Taxi Route, Contact Ground 121.600*

#####  4.2.2.1. 34 Arrival Taxi Routes

#### 4.2.3. Separation requirements

##### 4.2.3.1. General
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold.

##### 4.2.3.2. Speed control
AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed in order to ensure minimum separation between aircrafts.

> **AIR:** *SVA123, reduce to final approach speed.*

##### 4.2.3.3. Wake turbulence separation minima
Standard ICAO Separation is enforce in the Jeddah CTR.

#### 4.2.4. Go around procedure

At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima  is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

> **AIR:** *“SVA123, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge”*

Once aircraft have acknowledged the instruction and are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control.

Example: *“SVA123, fly standard missed approach procedure, climb 4000 feet, contact Jeddah Approach 124.0”*

!!! info "Go around vs cancel approach"

    A go-around occurs when an aircraft aborts its landing during the final approach phase after reaching the minimum descent altitude. In contrast, a "cancel approach" instruction is given when the aircraft is still in the early stages of the approach. The key difference is that during a cancel approach, air traffic control provides all the missed approach procedures in a single transmission since there is no immediate urgency. On the other hand, during a go-around, the controller instructs the aircraft to initiate the climb, and further instructions are provided once the aircraft is in the climb phase. 

---
###  4.3 VFR procedures
!!! caution "Do note." 
    VFR is only allowed at daytime. Night VFR is not permitted in the Jeddah Control Zone.


#### 4.3.1. Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)
**Visual Report Points (VRPs)** are specific geographical locations used in aviation to assist pilots in navigation and communication with air traffic control. These points help pilots maintain situational awareness and provide reference points for reporting their position during flight.

VRPs are typically marked by prominent landmarks, such as buildings, intersections, or natural features, making them easily identifiable from the air. They are particularly useful in busy airspace, allowing pilots to report their locations accurately, which helps air traffic controllers manage traffic effectively and ensure safety.

| **Ident** |                                                            **Name**                                                            | **Bearing and Distance** | **Coordinates** |
