!!! success "Covering"
    This section details all the necessary Standard Operating Procedures for Tower Operations in **King Fahd International Airport (OEDF)**

---

##  1. General Provisions

The **Dammam Tower (AIR)** is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information to VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

---

##  2. Designated Area of Responsibility
**King Fahd International Airport (OEDF)** features two primary AIR position. The responsibilities and areas of control for each position are outlined as follows:

### 2.2. AIR 1 [Dammam Tower]
**Dammam Tower [OEDF_1_TWR]** covers the western runway:

- 34L/16R

### 2.3. AIR E [Dammam Tower]
**Dammam Tower [OEDF_2_TWR]** covers the eastern runway:

- 34R/16L

### 2.4. Standard Connection Hierarchy 
Controllers must log in the following order to maintain realizm and follow SOPs: 

- AIR 1 [OEDF_1_TWR]
- AIR 2 [OEDF_2_TWR]

This hierarchy of connection must always be followed unless ATS staff explictly permit you to do otherwise.

---

## 3. Runway Configurations

### 3.1 General
The hierarchy of responsibility for determining the runway configuration is outlined as follows:

- AIR 1
- APP
- CTR
- SMC 1

!!! tip "Do note"
    It is the **ultimate responsibility** of the tower controllers to set the active runways! In any airport!

    So as long as there is a tower controller, it is his responsibility to set the active runway and ATIS, if not online, follow the hierarchy above

### 3.2 Preferential Runway System [PRS]
In Dammam, the Preferential Runway System is in use. In conditions of slack winds, 34 operation is preferred up to a tailwind component of 6kts.

This is the more efficent configuration, thus it is used as much as possible.

!!! tip "Crosswind"
    In the event of a direct crosswind (250 degrees) with a speed exceeding 7 knots, the following guidelines should be followed to determine the runway configuration:

    - Check the Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) for any indications of a potential change in weather conditions that may necessitate a different runway configuration.
    - If the TAF suggests a possible shift in weather conditions that would favor an alternative configuration, select the runway configuration that aligns with the forecasted conditions.
    - However, if the TAF does not indicate any expected changes that would warrant a different configuration, default to using the 34 Configs (presumably a reference to a specific set of runway configurations).

### 3.3 Standard Runway Configuration
At King Fahd International Airport, standard runway configurations for normal operations are established and ranked in order of preference. 

The configurations, listed from most preferred to least preferred, are as follows:

- 34s
- 16s

#### 3.3.1 34s and 16s Operations
The **Western Runway (34L/16R)** is the busiest at King Fahd International Airport, as most civil operations take place on the western side of the aerodrome. It handles all cargo and passenger flights arriving at and departing from the airport.

The **Eastern Runway (34R/16L)** is only used upon pilot request, or for the following operations:

- VFR Circuits
- Royal Flights
- Aramco Flights
- Oxford Training Flights

!!! warning "Beware"
    Refer to NOTAMs as runways might be closed.

---

##  4. Procedures
The below procedures are considered as standard and no coordination is required to employ them, except where explicitly required.

!!! caution 
    Should a situation arise that does not match any of the below cases, coordinate an arrangement with the affected agencies

### 4.1 Departure procedures
#### 4.1.1 Departure points

|    **Runway**    |  **Departure point**  |
|:----------------:|:---------------------:|
|        34L       |         B1, B2        |
|        34R       |          J, J1        |
|        16R       |         B6, B7        |
|        16L       |       R / J, J3       |
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.1.1. - Departure points
</p>

#### 4.1.2 Line up clearances

If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

Conditional line up instructions shall include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission.

!!! Example
    Normal clearance:
    > **AIR:** *“SVA123, Via B1, line up runway 34L”*

    Conditional clearance:
    > **AIR:** *“FAD123, Behind the departing Saudia A321, Via B1, line up runway 34L behind”*

#### 4.1.3 Take-off clearances

Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists

> **Air:** *“SVA123, Winds 340 degrees 10knots, Runway 34L, cleared for take-off”*

#### 4.1.4 Separation requirements

Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima, ICAO standard wake turbulence separation.

Succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of 2 minutes.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.

#### 4.1.5 Low visibility and IMC

During low visibility operations and during IMC, departing aircraft shall not be cleared for take-off when there is an arriving aircraft within 4 NM of the landing runway threshold.

Traffic should report **"airborne"** after take-off. Once airborne they should then be handed off to the appropriate station.

##### 4.1.5.1 Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs)

- When RVR reading is less than 550 meters, or surface visibility is less than 800 meters when RVR is U/S, or when aircraft ground movement cannot be observed by ATC, aircraft ground movement shall be restricted to one arrival one departure at a time.
- **Follow me** service shall be provided when requested.
- All departures shall be from the beginning of the RWY, no intermediate departure is permitted.

#### 4.1.6 IFR handoff procedure

IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate departure controller as instructed.

#### 4.1.7 Stopping a departure

If the departing aircraft has to abort takeoff, the Tower controller shall use the following
phraseology and instruct the aircraft twice. After the instruction, the Tower controller shall
confirm that the aircraft has acknowledged the cancel takeoff instruction.

This is a common occurrence on VATSIM when an aircraft randomly connects to the network while
on an active runway. Once conditions permit, if the aircraft needs to return to the end of
the runway for takeoff, the Tower controller shall instruct the aircraft to hold short of the
closest taxiway parallel to the active runway and hand off the aircraft to Ground.

!!! Example
    Takeoff roll commenced 
    > **AIR:** *"SVA123 stop immediately, I say again stop immediately. acknowledge"*

    Takeoff roll not commenced
    > **AIR:** *"SVA123 hold position, cancel takeoff clearance. I say again cancel takeoff clearance, due ground crew on runway"*

###  4.2 Arrival procedures
#### 4.2.1 Preferred exit points

|    **Runway**   |     **Exit points**     |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|
|        34L      |           B4            |
|        34R      |            H            |
|        16R      |           B3            |
|        16L      |            J            |
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.2.1 - Preferred exit points
</p>

On initial contact with AIR, traffic **must** be advised to expect an exit point along with a landing clearance.

> **AIR:** *"SVA123, Plan to vacate B4, winds 340 degrees 10kts, runway 34L, cleared to land"*

!!! info "Do note"
    **Runway 34R**:

    - All arrival traffic intending to park on **Apron 1** and **Apron 2**, when landing on **RWY34R** are to vacate the runway via **taxiway H** and to hold short of taxiway Romeo, if unable, vacate the runway via the end.
    
    - It is not permitted to turn left on **taxiway R** directly from the runway if passing **taxiway H** unless otherwise instructed by ATC.

    **Runway 16L**:

    - All arrival traffic landing on **RWY16L**, after vacating the runway and joining taxiway Juliet intending to park on **Aprons 1 ,2 and 5** shall hold position well before intersection **J3** facing north. ATC will issue further taxi instruction based on traffic situation.

#### 4.2.2 Separation requirements
##### 4.2.2.1 General
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold.

##### 4.2.2.2 Speed control
AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed in order to ensure minimum separation between aircrafts.

> **AIR:** *SVA123, reduce to final approach speed.*

##### 4.2.2.3 Wake turbulence separation minima
Standard ICAO Separation is enforced in the Dammam CTR.

#### 4.2.3 Go around procedure

At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima  is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

> **AIR:** *“SVA123, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge”*

Once aircraft have acknowledged the instruction and are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control.

> **AIR:** *“SVA123, fly standard missed approach procedure, climb 3000 feet, contact Dammam Approach 126.3”*

!!! info "Go around vs cancel approach"
    When the go around is before the minimums, the phraseology is the full with climb instructions and everything except handoff. When he starts climbing, it's a handoff.

For short final go-around, say the acknowledge thing first, then when he starts climbing, everything else including handoff.

###  4.3 VFR procedures
!!! caution "Do note." 
    VFR is only allowed at daytime. Night VFR is not permitted in the Dammam Control Zone.

#### 4.3.1. Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)
**Visual Report Points (VRPs)** are specific geographical locations used in aviation to assist pilots in navigation and communication with air traffic control. These points help pilots maintain situational awareness and provide reference points for reporting their position during flight.

VRPs are typically marked by prominent landmarks, such as buildings, intersections, or natural features, making them easily identifiable from the air. They are particularly useful in busy airspace, allowing pilots to report their locations accurately, which helps air traffic controllers manage traffic effectively and ensure safety.

!!! danger "Do note."
    - These VRPS are not to be used as holding points.

##### 4.3.1.1 Entry/Exit VRPs into the CTR
According to the eAIP traffic must only enter/exit the Dammam Control Zone via the following VRPs:

- WASLA
- RQUBA

Clearance to enter from controlled airspace is issued by APP; for uncontrolled airspace, the clearance is issued by TWR.

All VFR Traffic must contact the TWR 10NM prior to the entry VRP.

!!! info "Rejection"
    The TWR controller has the right to reject any traffic into the control zone if deemed neccesary.
    > **AIR:** *HHAZA, You are not cleared to enter the control zone, remain outside of the control zone until XXXX()

#### 4.3.2. VFR departures
Any VFR aircraft leaving the control zone at Dammam is considered to be engaging in cross-country VFR flight.

Coordination between the AIR and APP is required.

All VFR Departures must exit the control zone through the entry/exit VRPs described in section 4.3.1.1.

!!! info "Do note"
    VFR Crosscountry traffic are considered as departures and shall depart from the active departure runway unless needed otherwise by AIR.

##### 4.3.2.1 VFR departures with UVR
VFR aircraft desiring to exit Dammam CTR shall follow the published urban VFR routes by GACA.

##### 4.3.2.2 VFR departures without UVR
Upon request, VFR aircraft may exit Dammam CTR either along their intended track or as directed by AIR.

#### 4.3.3. VFR arrivals
All VFR Arrivals must enter the control zone through the entry/exit VRPs described in section 4.3.1.1.

Clearance to enter the Control Zone is issued by Approach.

Once the traffic has entered the control zone, further intructions to direct to a VRP or to join a downwind can be issued by tower
