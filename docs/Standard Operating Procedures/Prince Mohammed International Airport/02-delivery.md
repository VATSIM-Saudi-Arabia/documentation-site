# Medinah Delivery [OEMA_GND]

!!! success "Covering"
    This section details all the necessary Standard Operating Procedures for Delivery Operations in **Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport (OEMA)**

!!! Warning "Disclaimer"
    Medinah does not have GMP position, thus it's covered by the Ground controller.

## 1. General Provisions
**Medinah Ground (OEMA_GND)** is entrusted with the task of validating routes and providing IFR/VFR clearances to departing aircraft. This involves carefully reviewing the flight plan and cross-verifying the accuracy of the filed route, assigned level, and departure procedure. In situations where any inconsistencies, errors, or invalid information are identified, the controller must rectify the errors and issue a reclearance.

Additionally, the GMP plays a vital role in minimizing potential delays and congestion on the taxiways for outbound flights. During periods characterized by increased departure activities, the GMP implements proactive measures to optimize the flow of traffic. This includes holding aircraft at their stands.

## 2. Departure Clearance
### 2.1 General
GMP is responsible for issuing IFR/VFR clearances for departing aircraft. Pilots may be expected to report the
following information on first contact:

-   Callsign;
-   Aircraft type;
-   Parking stand;
-   Destination;
-   Any other special requests

### 2.2 IFR Clearances
An IFR clearance shall contain:

-   Destination (Optional);
-   Departure procedure;
-   Departure runway;
-   Initial climb;
-   Assigned SSR code

#### 2.2.1 Phraseology
In Medinah, the standard GACA phrasesology is used. For IFR Clearances, the following phrasesolgy must strictly be adhered to.
> **Pilot:** _"SVA123, Stand 117, A320, requesting IFR clearance to Riyadh"_

> **GMP:** _"SVA123, Cleared Riyadh as filed, MEDRO1K Departure, Runway 35, Initial Climb 8000ft, SQWK XXXX"_

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
  --------------------------------------------------------------Pilot Readbacks--------------------------------------------------------------
</p>

> **GMP:** _"SVA123, Readback Correct, Information A, Report ready for push and start"_

!!! tip "Keep in mind"
    GMP shall obtain a full readback of the clearance. If the pilot reports the current information on initial contact, GMP must not repeat it.

#### 2.2.2 Departure Procedures
##### 2.2.2.1 RNAV SIDs
Medinah Airport predominantly utilizes **RNAV standard instrument departures (SIDs)** as the preferred departure method for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules (IFR). The selection of the appropriate RNAV departure for departing aircraft is based on the exit point specified in the flight plan and the active runways at the airport.

| **Exit Points** | **ALTEP** | **MEDRO** | **MIXUG** | **PEGUR** | **SISUD** | **UKTOM** |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
|      **17**     |    1J     |    1J     |    1J     |    1J     |    1J     |    1J     |
|      **35**     |    1K     |    1K     |    1K     |    1K     |    1K     |    1K     |
|      **18**     |    1C     |    1C     |    1C     |    1C     |    1C     |    1C     |
|      **36**     |    1L     |    1L     |    1L     |    1L     |    1L     |    1L     |
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
  Table 1.1 - RNAV SIDs of Medinah
</p>

!!! info "Initial Climb"
    In Medinah, regardless of the specific SID chosen, all departures should be assigned an initial climb of **8000 feet**.

##### 2.2.2.2 Radar Departures
Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport (OEMA) offers two radar departures, namely **MADINAH 1Z** for **Runway 17/18**, and **MADINAH 1T** for **Runway 35/36**, respectively. These departure procedures involve the aircraft flying the runway heading until further instructions are provided by APP.

It is important to note that these radar departures should only be utilized when necessary, and their usage requires coordination with APP.

!!! Example
    SVA123 is requesting MADINAH 1T due to outdated AIRAC. GMP must call APP via VCCS to coordinate:

    > **GMP:** _Calls APP via VCCS_

    > **APP:** _Accepts call from GMP_

    > **GMP -> APP:** _"APP, SVA123 is an A320 requesting approval for MADINAH 1T"_

    > **APP -> GMP:** _"GMP, MADINAH 1T approved"_

##### 2.2.2.3 Omni-Directional Departures
Omnidirectional departures can be issued in coordination with AIR & APP.

An Omnidirectional departure clearance shall contain the following information:

-   Callsign;
-   Destination (Optional);
-   Expect Radar vectors;
-   Departure Runway;
-   Initial climb;
-   Assigned SSR code

> **Pilot:** _"SVA123, Stand 117, A320, requesting IFR clearance to Riyadh"_

> **GMP:** _"SVA123, Cleared Riyadh as filed, Expect Radar Vectors, Runway 35, Initial Climb 8000ft, SQWK XXXX"_

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
  --------------------------------------------------------------Pilot Readbacks--------------------------------------------------------------
</p>

> **GMP:** _"SVA123, Readback Correct, Information A, Report ready for push and start"_

!!! Do note
    The pilot can receive an initial heading as part of the departure clearance, but it should only be given if instructed by AIR & APP.

##### 2.2.2.4 Phraseology
> **GMP:** _"SVA123, Cleared Riyadh as filed, After departure, Maintain Runway Heading, Runway 35, Initial Climb 8000ft, SQWK XXXX"_

**_OR_**

> **GMP:** _"SVA123, Cleared Riyadh as filed, After departure, Turn left heading 310, Runway 35, Initial Climb 8000ft, SQWK XXXX"_

!!! Example
    FAD5MA is requesting Omni-Directional due to technical malfunctions. GMP must call APP via VCCS to coordinate

    > **GMP:** _Calls APP via VCCS_

    > **APP:** _Accepts call from GMP_

    > **GMP -> APP:** _"APP, SVA123 is an A320. Requesting approval for Omni-Directional Departure"_

    > **APP -> GMP:** _"GMP, Omni-Directional approved"_ | **(Use Expect Radar Vectors in Clearance)**

    **_OR_**

    > **APP -> GMP:** _"GMP, Omni-Directional approved, Runway heading/Left Turn heading 310 after departure"_ | **(Use Maintain Runway Heading/Assigned heading in Clearance)*

!!! tip
    When giving Radar Departures, type **"RDEP"** or **"OMNI"** in the scratch pad so upper controllers don't forget and you too!

#### 2.2.3 Rerouting Traffic
The responsibility of ensuring that all aircraft have the accurate and realistic route lies with the GMP. The GMP should utilize the RouteChecker tool for this purpose.

If a traffic files an invalid route, they shall be informed by GMP of such as soon as they have connected to the network by private message or on frequency.

##### 2.2.3.1 Rerouting by voice
GMP may use the following phrasesolgy to reroute traffic.

> **GMP:** _"SVA123, Cleared Riyadh, MEDRO J852 KIA, Flight plan route, MEDRO1K, Runway 35, Initial Climb 8000ft, SQWK XXXX"_

Altough this is allowed, it consumes time on frequency which maybe needed for other traffic on the frequency. Therefore, Rerouting by Private Message is preferred.

##### 2.2.3.2 Rerouting by private message
This is the preferred way of rerouting traffic. Refer to the Alias.

#### 2.2.4 Crusing Flight Level (CFL)
GMP must ensure all traffic are cleared on the appropriate CFL.

##### 2.2.4.1 Semi-Circular Rule
GMP must ensure the semi-circular rule is followed. For more information regarding the Semi-Circular Rule, refer to the Saudi S1 Training vMATS.
