# Medinah Tower [OEMA_TWR]

!!! success "Covering"
    This section details all the necessary Standard Operating Procedures for Tower Operations in **Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport (OEMA)**

---

##  1. General Provisions

The **Medinah Tower (AIR)** is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information to VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

---

##  2. Designated Area of Responsibility
**Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport (OEMA)** features one primary AIR position. The responsibilities and areas of control for each position are outlined as follows:

### 2.1. Airspace
**Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport (OEMA)** Control Zone (CTR) is Class D airspace and is centered around the aerodrome. Its ceiling is 5500ft AGL and has a radius of 10NM.

### 2.2. AIR [Medinah Tower]
**Medinah Tower [OEMA_TWR]** covers all runways in the aerodrome:

- 35/17
- 36/18

---

## 3. Runway Configurations

### 3.1 General
The hierarchy of responsibility for determining the runway configuration is outlined as follows:

 - AIR
 - APP
 - CTR
 - SMC

!!! tip "Do note"
    It is the **ultimate responsibility** of the tower controllers to set the active runways! In any airport!

    So as long as there is a tower controller, it is his responsibility to set the active runway and ATIS, if not online, follow the hierarchy above

### 3.2 Preferential Runway System [PRS]
In Medinah, the Preferential Runway System is in use. In conditions of slack winds, 35 operation is preferred up to a tailwind component of 6kts.

This is the more efficent configuration, thus it is used as much as possible.

!!! tip "Crosswind"
    In the event of a direct crosswind (250 degrees) with a speed exceeding 7 knots, the following guidelines should be followed to determine the runway configuration:

    - Check the Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) for any indications of a potential change in weather conditions that may necessitate a different runway configuration.
    - If the TAF suggests a possible shift in weather conditions that would favor an alternative configuration, select the runway configuration that aligns with the forecasted conditions.
    - However, if the TAF does not indicate any expected changes that would warrant a different configuration, default to using the 34 Configs (presumably a reference to a specific set of runway configurations).

### 3.3 Standard Runway Configuration
At Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport, standard runway configurations for normal operations are established and ranked in order of preference. 

The configurations, listed from most preferred to least preferred, are as follows:

- 35
- 17

!!! info "Do note."
    Exceptions to runway configurations can be granted per pilot's request after approval from AIR and APP. 

    **Standard Exceptions:**

    - VFR Circuits
    - Royal Flights [Always departs/arrives on 36/18 regardless of the active config]
    - Military Flights [Always departs/arrives on 36/18 regardless of the active config]

##  4. Procedures
The below procedures are considered as standard and no coordination is required to employ them, except where explicitly required.

!!! caution 
    Should a situation arise that does not match any of the below cases, coordinate an arrangement with the affected agencies

### 4.1 Departure procedures
#### 4.1.1 Departure points

|    **Runway**    |  **Departure point**  |
|:----------------:|:---------------------:|
|        35        |       J, J1 / A       |
|        36        |            D          |
|        17        |       J7, J8 / D      |
|        18        |            C          |
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.1.1. - Departure points
</p>

#### 4.1.2 Line up clearances

If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

Conditional line up instructions shall include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission.

!!! Example
    Normal clearance:
    > **AIR:** *“SVA123, Via J1, line up runway 35”*

    Conditional clearance:
    > **AIR:** *“FAD123, Behind the departing Saudia A321, Via J1, line up runway 35 behind”*

#### 4.1.3 Take-off clearances

Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists

> **Air:** *“SVA123, Winds 340 degrees 10knots, Runway 34R, cleared for take-off”*

#### 4.1.4 Separation requirements

Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima, standard wake turbulence separation or RE-CAT.

Succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of 2 minutes.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.

#### 4.1.5 Low visibility and IMC

During low visibility operations and during IMC, departing aircraft shall not be cleared for take-off when there is an arriving aircraft within 4 NM of the landing runway threshold.

Traffic should report **"airborne"** after take-off. Once airborne they should then be handed off to the appropriate station.

#### 4.1.6 IFR handoff procedure

IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate departure controller as instructed.

#### 4.1.7 Stopping a departure

If the departing aircraft has to abort takeoff, the Tower controller shall use the following
phraseology and instruct the aircraft twice. After the instruction, the Tower controller shall
confirm that the aircraft has acknowledged the cancel takeoff instruction.

This is a common occurrence on VATSIM when an aircraft randomly connects to the network while
on an active runway. Once conditions permit, if the aircraft needs to return to the end of
the runway for takeoff, the Tower controller shall instruct the aircraft to hold short of the
closest taxiway parallel to the active runway and hand off the aircraft to Ground.

!!! Example
    Takeoff roll commenced 
    > **AIR:** *"SVA123 stop immediately, I say again stop immediately. Aknowledge"*

    Takeoff roll not commenced
    > **AIR:** *"SVA123 hold position, cancel takeoff clearance. I say again cancel takeoff clearance, due ground crew on runway"*

###  4.2 Arrival procedures
#### 4.2.1 Preferred exit points

|    **Runway**   |     **Exit points**     |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|
|        35       |         J4, J5          |
|        36       |          G, H           |
|        17       |         J2, J3          |
|        18       |          A, B           |
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.2.1 - Preferred exit points
</p>

On initial contact with AIR, traffic **must** be advised to expect an exit point along with a landing clearance.

> **AIR:** *"SVA123, Plan to vacate J4, winds 340 degrees 10kts, runway 35, cleared to land"*

#### 4.2.2 Separation requirements

##### 4.2.2.1 General
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold.

##### 4.2.2.2 Speed control
AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed in order to ensure minimum separation between aircrafts.

> **AIR:** *SVA123, reduce to final approach speed.*

##### 4.2.2.3 Wake turbulence separation minima
Standard ICAO Separation is enforce in the Medinah CTR.

#### 4.2.3 Go around procedure

At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima  is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

> **AIR:** *“SVA123, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge”*

Once aircraft have acknowledged the instruction and are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control.

> **AIR:** *“SVA123, fly standard missed approach procedure, climb 6000 feet, contact Medinah Approach 125.1”*

!!! info "Go around vs cancel approach"

    A go-around occurs when an aircraft aborts its landing during the final approach phase after reaching the minimum descent altitude. In contrast, a "cancel approach" instruction is given when the aircraft is still in the early stages of the approach. The key difference is that during a cancel approach, air traffic control provides all the missed approach procedures in a single transmission since there is no immediate urgency. On the other hand, during a go-around, the controller instructs the aircraft to initiate the climb, and further instructions are provided once the aircraft is in the climb phase. 

###  4.3 VFR procedures
!!! caution "Do note." 
    VFR is only allowed at daytime. Night VFR is not permitted in the Medinah Control Zone.


#### 4.3.1. Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)
**Visual Report Points (VRPs)** are specific geographical locations used in aviation to assist pilots in navigation and communication with air traffic control. These points help pilots maintain situational awareness and provide reference points for reporting their position during flight.

VRPs are typically marked by prominent landmarks, such as buildings, intersections, or natural features, making them easily identifiable from the air. They are particularly useful in busy airspace, allowing pilots to report their locations accurately, which helps air traffic controllers manage traffic effectively and ensure safety.

| **Ident** |  **Location Geographic**  | **Radial and distance** | **Coordinates**  |
|:---------:|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------:|
|  **MAD1** |    King Fahad hospital    |   R244 from PMA 8.6NM   | 242945N 0393359E |
|  **MAD2** |            NIL            |   R119 from PMA 7.8NM   | 242828N 0395016E |
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.3.1 - Medinah VRPs
</p>

!!! danger "Do note."
    - These VRPS are not to be used as holding points.

!!! caution "Pilots"
    Kindly keep in mind that not all pilots have access to these VRPs as it is difficult to find. VFR Charts with VRPs are also not public.

    The Saudi Arabian vACC is working to release a pilot briefing document for VFR.

##### 4.3.1.1 Entry/Exit VRPs into the CTR
According to the eAIP traffic must only enter/exit the Medinah Control Zone via the following VRPs:
- MAD1
- MAD2

Clearance to enter the control zone is issued by APP.

!!! caution "Do note"
    All VFR flights shall enter Medinah CTR via this VRP and must contact the TWR 10NM prior the VRP.

!!! info "Rejection"
    The TWR controller has the right to reject any traffic into the control zone if deemed neccesary.
    > **AIR:** *HHAZA, You are not cleared to enter the control zone, remain outside of the control zone until XXXX()


#### 4.3.2. VFR departures
Any VFR aircraft leaving the control zone at Medinah is considered to be engaging in cross-country VFR flight.

Coordination between the AIR and APP is required.

All VFR Departures must exit the control zone through the entry/exit VRPs described in section 4.3.1.1.

!!! info "Do note"
    VFR Crosscountry traffic are considered as departures and shall depart from the active departure runway unless needed otherwise by AIR.

#### 4.3.3. VFR arrivals
All VFR Arrivals must enter the control zone through the entry/exit VRPs described in section 4.3.1.1.

Clearance to enter the Control Zone is issued by Approach.

Once the traffic has entered the control zone, further intructions to direct to a VRP or to join a downwind can be issued by tower.

#### 4.3.4. VFR circuits

|     **Runway Configuration**      |  **Direction**  | **Altitude(s)** |
| :-------------------------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
|               35/36               |    Right Hand   |    1500ft AGL   |
|               17/18               |    Left Hand    |    1500ft AGL   |

!!! info "Jet Engine Aircrafts"
    Jet engine aircraft must conduct circuits on the **eastern side of the aerodrome**, maintaining ***2000 feet***.

!!! danger "Do note"
    Circling in Circuits are not allowed in west of the aerodrome.
