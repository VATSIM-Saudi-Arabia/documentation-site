## 3. Controller Conduct
### 3.1 Operation Conduct
All controllers are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that upholds professionalism.

- **Adherence to VATSIM Regulations** <br> Controllers members are expected to fully comply with the VATSIM Code of Conduct and Code of Regulations as the governing framework for participation.

- **Good Standing Requirement** <br> Controllers must remain in good standing with the Saudi Arabian vACC, VATMENA, VATEMEA, and the VATSIM network.

- **Disciplinary Actions** <br> Controller found to be in violation of the VATSIM Code of Conduct, whether serving in the capacity of a controller, pilot, or observer, **shall be subject to immediate removal from the Saudi Arabian vACC roster**. Such removal will be enforced without the requirement of prior notification

- **Compliance with Policies and Procedures** <br> Controllers must comply with all applicable Saudi Arabian vACC standards, policies, and procedures, including:

    - The Saudi Arabian vACC Training Policy
    - SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)
    - vMATS (Virtual Manual of Air Traffic Services)
    - Procedure Changes
    - Letters of Agreement (LoAs)

- **Prohibition of Misconduct** <br> Hate speech, violence, derogatory remarks, or personal attacks directed at pilots or fellow controllers will result in immediate and permanent termination from the Saudi Arabian vACC, with further escalation to the VATSIM network.

---

### 3.2 Language Requirement

- **English Proficiency** <br> English is the required language for all controller-pilot communication on VATSIM, in line with ICAO standards.

- **Rate of Speech** <br> The speed and clarity with which transmissions are delivered should ensure instructions are easily understood by the Pilots without ambiguity. Controllers must balance efficiency with comprehensibility, maintaining a steady pace—neither too fast to cause misinterpretation nor too slow to impede traffic flow.

- **Use of Standard Phraseology** <br> Controllers must use GACA, and ICAO-standard phraseology, as specified in the Saudi Arabian Radiotelephony Manual.

---

### 3.3 Operational Standards
The Saudi Arabian vACC upholds a rigorous standard of operational realism and professional excellence in the provision of air traffic control services.

- **Adherence to Official Procedures** <br> Controllers must follow the procedures outlined in:
    - Training vMATS
    - Published SOPs
    - Procedure Changes
    - Letters of Agreement (LoAs)

- **Training Policy Compliance** <br> Controllers must adhere to:
    - The Saudi Arabian vACC Training Process for Resident and Visiting Controllers.

---

### 3.4 Availability and Staffing

- **Staffing Requirement** <br> Controllers are required to remain at their assigned position and maintain continuous, active supervision of their station throughout the entirety of the session.

- **Temporary Absences** <br> Controllers are required to disconnect from the network if intending to be absent from their position for more than **5 minutes**. Reconnection shall only be made once they are fully prepared to resume all operational responsibilities.

- **Session Termination** <br> Controllers are required to adhere to the prescribed coordination protocol outlined in the “Pending, or Ternimating a Session” section prior to terminating their connection.

---

### 3.5 Minimum Session Time
Controllers shall adhere to the following minimum session time obligations:

| **Position**  | **Minimum Session Time** |
|:-------------:|:------------------------:|
|    DEL/GND    |        30 Minutes        |
|      TWR      |        30 Minutes        |
|    DEP/APP    |        40 Minutes        |
|      CTR      |        40 Minutes        |

Any session of less than the required duration shall be excluded from the controller’s quarterly accumulation. Persistent failure to comply with this provision may result in disciplinary actions.

---

## 4. Controller Coordination
### 4.1 Starting a Session
Controllers are required to finalize all coordination protocols prior to assuming any position. They must verify the presence of adjacent controllers within the coordination channels on the Saudi Arabian vACC Discord server.

Controllers shall only utilise callsigns and frequencies approved for use by the Operations Department.

1. **Controller consults the VATSIM Radar, or an equivalent platform, to verify the presence of active ATC coverage**.
    1. If Adjacent controllers are not online:
        1. Review the most recent NOTAMs and real-world air traffic conditions to appropriately adjust and mitigate operational implications
        2. Review the latest METAR and TAF to determine ATIS and most appropriate runway configuration

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
    Log on desired position
    </p>

    2. If Adjacent controllers are online:
        1. Log on as an Observer
        2. Coordinate with the next controller to determine ATIS, runways in use, and operational info

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
    Log on desired position
    </p>

---

### 4.2 Discord Presence
For the purposes of coordination, controllers operating concurrently with adjacent positions within the Saudi Arabian vACC are **required** to remain active on Discord to facilitate seamless communication. During events, controllers **shall** be present in the designated coordination channels on Discord to ensure effective and uninterrupted collaboration with neighboring positions.

---

### 4.3 Swapping Positions
Controllers wishing to take over or relief an occupied position using the published callsign shall utilize an additional letter `(R)` prior to the final suffix to make the position recognizable to pilots. **(e.g. OEJN_W_TWR becomes OEJN_WR_TWR)** unless an alternative is published by the Operations Department.

---

### 4.4 Pending, or Ternimating a Session
Controllers must notify others of their intent to disconnect using the `.break` function on EuroScope and announce it either via `/atc` channel or voice at least 5 minutes before disconnecting.

In cases where the neighboring position needs to step away shortly during peak hours, the use of **Cross-coupling of frequencies** may be employed for a period not exceeding **10 minutes** to accommodate brief absences from the primary frequency.

!!! Example
    AIR controller shall coordinate with APP to take over his frequency during his absence for a short period of time.

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution
In the event of a conflict, controllers shall first seek informal resolution by contacting the vACC Director or Deputy Director. Should the matter remain unresolved, it may be escalated to the Division Director or the DCRM for further action.

---

## 6. Non-compliance with this Policy
Lack of awareness of established policies shall not be considered a valid justification. Each member is responsible for remaining informed of the latest procedures. Repeated violations may result in the revocation of existing approvals.
