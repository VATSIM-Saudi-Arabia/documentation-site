## 4. Controller Coordination
### 4.1 Starting a Session
Controllers are required to finalize all coordination protocols prior to assuming any position. They must verify the presence of adjacent controllers within the coordination channels on the Saudi Arabian vACC Discord server.

1. **Controller consults the VATSIM Radar, or an equivalent platform, to verify the presence of active ATC coverage**.
    1. If Adjacent controllers are not online:
        1. Review the most recent NOTAMs and real-world air traffic conditions to appropriately adjust and mitigate operational implications
        2. Review the latest METAR and TAF to determine ATIS and most appropriate runway configuration

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
    Log on desired position
    </p>

    2. If Adjacent controllers are online:
        1. Log on as an Observer
        2. Coordinate with the next controller to determine ATIS, runways in use, and operational info

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
    Log on desired position
    </p>

---

### 4.2 Discord Presence
For the purposes of coordination, controllers operating concurrently with adjacent positions within the Saudi Arabian vACC are **required** to remain active on Discord to facilitate seamless communication. During events, controllers **shall** be present in the designated coordination channels on Discord to ensure effective and uninterrupted collaboration with neighboring positions.
