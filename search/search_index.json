Behind.</p> <p>Airline</p> <p>When giving the clearance, the \"airline\" should be mentioned and not \"callsign\". </p> <p>For example:</p> <p>SMC: SVA123, After the Etihad Airways (~~Etihad~~) A321 passing from your left to right, push &amp; start approved, face south on C. Behind.</p> <p>In addition, if both aircraft involved in the conditional pushback instruction belong to the same airline, it is common to specify the relationship by saying \"Behind the Company A321\".</p> <p>Do note.</p> <p>The traffic is only mandated to say \"Behind\" once.

Sometimes even if the two operators listen out before transmitting, it is possible that they press their buttons at precisely the same moment. The probability of such an event increases in busy frequencies.</li> <li>Callsign confusion. Sometimes messages by air traffic controllers are considered relevant by more than one flight crew.

For example, a wind blowing from a direction of 273\u00b0 true with a speed of 18 knots would be reported as 27018KT.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown above, the wind direction is represented by arrows indicating the direction of the wind flow. In the left scenario, the wind is indicated as 030XXKT, meaning it is coming from 030\u00b0 with \"XX\" denoting the wind speed in knots. In the right scenario, the wind is stated as 210XXKT, indicating a wind direction from 210\u00b0.</p> <p>It is important to remember that the runway heading is opposite to the wind direction. When standing in the middle of the runway and facing the runway heading, the wind would be blowing from the opposite direction. For example, if the runway heading is 180\u00b0, the wind from 030\u00b0 would be a headwind, and the wind from 210\u00b0 would be a tailwind when considering takeoff or landing along that runway.</p>"},{"location":"Training%20vMATS/%28S1%29%20Developing%20Controller%20Training%20vMATS/8.%20ATIS/03-%208.3%20Active%20Runways/#842-wind-versus-take-off-and-landing-movement","title":"8.4.2   Wind versus take off and landing movement","text":"<p>Prior to takeoff and landing, pilots carefully consider the wind conditions as a crucial factor. It is preferable for aircraft to operate in conditions where they can take off and land into the wind, known as headwinds. This approach helps reduce the necessary speeds for becoming airborne during takeoff and for safely coming to a stop after landing.</p> <p>Minimum take-off and landing speed</p> <p>All aircraft strive to take off against the wind due to the principles of reaction and aerodynamics. When taking off into headwinds, the force exerted on the wings generates an upward thrust, enabling the aircraft to achieve liftoff at a reduced speed. The same principle applies during landing, where headwinds allow the aircraft to land at lower speeds by utilizing the upward thrust caused by the winds.</p> <p>Winds with respect to the aircraft\u2019s direction</p> <ul> <li>Headwind</li> </ul> <p>When the wind opposes the aircraft's direction of movement, it is referred to as a headwind.</p> <ul> <li>Tailwind</li> </ul> <p>When the wind blows in the same direction as the aircraft's movement, it is referred to as a tailwind.</p> <ul> <li>Crosswind</li> </ul> <p>When the wind blows perpendicular to the aircraft's direction of movement, it is referred to as a crosswind.</p> <p> </p>"}]}
